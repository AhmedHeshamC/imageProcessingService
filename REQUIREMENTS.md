# Image Processing Service Requirements

This project involves creating a backend service for processing and transforming images, similar to Cloudinary. Here's a breakdown of the key requirements:

## Core Components

1. **User Authentication**
   - User registration (sign-up)
   - User login with JWT authentication
   - Secure endpoint access using JWTs

2. **Image Management**
   - Upload images
   - Transform images using various operations
   - Retrieve images in different formats
   - List uploaded images with metadata

3. **Image Transformations**
   - Resize
   - Crop
   - Rotate
   - Watermark
   - Flip
   - Mirror
   - Compress
   - Format conversion (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
   - Filters (grayscale, sepia, etc.)

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /register`: Create new user account
- `POST /login`: Log in existing user

### Image Operations
- `POST /images`: Upload a new image
- `POST /images/:id/transform`: Apply transformations to an image
- `GET /images/:id`: Retrieve an image
- `GET /images?page=1&limit=10`: Get paginated list of images

## Implementation Tips
- Use image processing libraries for transformations
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Consider caching transformed images for performance
- Add proper error handling and validation

This service will require database storage for user information and image metadata, file storage for the images themselves, and image processing capabilities to handle the various transformations.

# Recommended Technologies for Image Processing Service

Based on the requirements, here are the technologies I'd recommend for building your image processing service:

## Backend Framework
- **Node.js with Express.js** Provides a robust foundation for RESTful API development with middleware support for authentication, validation, and error handling

## Database

- **MySQL** - Recommended relational database for storing user information and image metadata

## Authentication
- **jsonwebtoken** - For JWT implementation
- **bcrypt** - For password hashing

## Image Storage

- **Local file system** for development/simpler setups

## Image Processing
- **Sharp** - High-performance Node.js image processing library, excellent for most transformations
- **Multer** - For handling file uploads in Express

## Additional Tools
- **express-rate-limit** - For API rate limiting implementation
- **Joi** or **express-validator** - For request validation
- **Winston** or **Pino** - For logging
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** - For API documentation
- **Nodemon** - For development server auto-reload
- **Memcached** - For caching transformed images and rate limiting
